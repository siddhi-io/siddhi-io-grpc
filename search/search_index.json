Features grpc ( Sink ) This extension publishes event data encoded into GRPC Classes as defined in the user input jar. This extension has a default gRPC service classes added. The default service is called \"EventService\". Please find the protobuf definition here . If we want to use our custom gRPC services, we have to pack auto-generated gRPC service classes and protobuf classes into a jar file and add it into the project classpath (or to the jars folder in the siddhi-tooling folder if we use it with siddhi-tooling ). Please find the custom protobuf definition that uses in examples here . This grpc sink is used for scenarios where we send a request and don't expect a response back.

A grpc server should be running at 194.23.98.100 listening to port 8080. sink.id is set to 1 here. So we can write a source with sink.id 1 so that it will listen to responses for requests published from this stream.

A grpc server should be running at 194.23.98.100 listening to port 8080. @payload is provided in this stream, therefore we can use any name for the attributes in the stream definition, but we should correctly map those names with protobuf message attributes.

When we need to send a stream of requests from the grpc sink we have to define a client stream RPC method(look the sample proto file that provided in the resource folder [here](https://github.com/siddhi-io/siddhi-io-grpc/tree/master/component/src/main/resources)).Then the siddhi will identify whether it's a unary method or a stream method and send requests according to the method type. grpc-call (Sink) This extension publishes event data encoded into GRPC Classes as defined in the user input jar.

We have added another stream called BarStream which is a grpc-call-response source with the same sink.id 1 and as same as FooStream definition. So the responses for calls sent from the FooStream will be added to BarStream. Since there is no mapping available in the stream definition attributes names should be as same as the attributes of the protobuf message definition. (Here the only reason we provide receiver.url in the grpc-call-response source is for protobuf mapper to map Response into a siddhi event, we can give any address and any port number in the URL, but we should provide the service name and the method name correctly) EXAMPLE 4 @sink(type='grpc-call', publisher.url = 'grpc://194.23.98.100:8888/org.wso2.grpc.test.MyService/process', sink.id= '1', @map(type='protobuf', @payload(stringValue='a',longValue='c',intValue='b',booleanValue='d',floatValue = 'e', doubleValue = 'f')))define stream FooStream (a string, b int,c long,d bool,e float,f double); @source(type='grpc-call-response', receiver.url = 'grpc://localhost:8888/org.wso2.grpc.test.MyService/process', sink.id= '1', @map(type='protobuf',@attributes(a = 'stringValue', b = 'intValue', c = 'longValue',d = 'booleanValue', e ='floatValue', f ='doubleValue')))define stream FooStream (a string, b int,c long,d bool,e float,f double); Here with the same FooStream definition we have added a BarStream which has a grpc-call-response source with the same sink.id 1. So the responses for calls sent from the FooStream will be added to BarStream. In this stream we provided mapping for both the sink and the source. so we can use any name for the attributes in the stream definition, but we have to map those attributes with correct protobuf attributes. As same as the grpc-sink, if we are planning to use metadata we should map the attributes. grpc-service-response (Sink) This extension is used to send responses back to a gRPC client after receiving requests through grpc-service source.

The source will receive responses for sink with the same sink.id. For example if you have a gRPC sink with sink.id 15 then we need to set the sink.id as 15 in the source to receives responses.

A grpc server should be running at 194.23.98.100 listening to port 8080. sink.id is set to 1 here. So we can write a source with sink.id 1 so that it will listen to responses for requests published from this stream. Note that since we are using EventService/consume the sink will be operating in default mode EXAMPLE 2 @sink(type='grpc', publisher.url = 'grpc://134.23.43.35:8080/org.wso2.grpc.EventService/consume', headers='{{headers}}', @map(type='json'), @payload('{{message}}')) define stream FooStream (message String, headers String); A similar example to above but with headers. Headers are also send into the stream as a data. In the sink headers dynamic property reads the value and sends it as MetaData with the request EXAMPLE 3 @sink(type='grpc', publisher.url = 'grpc://134.23.43.35:8080/org.wso2.grpc.MyService/send', @map(type='protobuf'), define stream FooStream (stringValue string, intValue int,longValue long,booleanValue bool,floatValue float,doubleValue double); Here a stream named FooStream is defined with grpc sink.

A grpc server should be running at 194.23.98.100 listening to port 8080. @payload is provided in this stream, therefore we can use any name for the attributes in the stream definition, but we should correctly map those names with protobuf message attributes. If we are planning to send metadata within a stream we should use @payload to map attributes to identify the metadata attribute and the protobuf attributes separately.

A grpc server should be running at 194.23.98.100 listening to port 8080. sink.id is set to 1 here. So we can write a source with sink.id 1 so that it will listen to responses for requests published from this stream. Note that since we are using EventService/consume the sink will be operating in default mode EXAMPLE 2 @sink(type='grpc', publisher.url = 'grpc://134.23.43.35:8080/org.wso2.grpc.EventService/consume', headers='{{headers}}', @map(type='json'), @payload('{{message}}')) define stream FooStream (message String, headers String); A similar example to above but with headers.

A grpc server should be running at 194.23.98.100 listening to port 8080. @payload is provided in this stream, therefore we can use any name for the attributes in the stream definition, but we should correctly map those names with protobuf message attributes. If we are planning to send metadata within a stream we should use @payload to map attributes to identify the metadata attribute and the protobuf attributes separately.

A grpc server should be running at 194.23.98.100 listening to port 8080. @payload is provided in this stream, therefore we can use any name for the attributes in the stream definition, but we should correctly map those names with protobuf message attributes.

With each request a header will be sent in MetaData in the following format: 'Name:John', 'Age:23' EXAMPLE 4 @sink(type='grpc-service-response', source.id='1', message.id='{{messageId}}', @map(type='protobuf', @payload(stringValue='a',intValue='b',longValue='c',booleanValue='d',floatValue = 'e', doubleValue ='f'))) define stream BarStream (a string,messageId string, b int,c long,d bool,e float,f double); @source(type='grpc-service', receiver.url='grpc://134.23.43.35:8888/org.wso2.grpc.test.MyService/process', source.id='1', @map(type='protobuf', @attributes(messageId='trp:message.id', a = 'stringValue', b = 'intValue', c = 'longValue',d = 'booleanValue', e = 'floatValue', f ='doubleValue'))) define stream FooStream (a string,messageId string, b int,c long,d bool,e float,f double); from FooStream select * insert into BarStream; Here a grpc server will be started at port 8888. The process method of the MyService will be exposed to the clients. 'source.id' is set as 1. So a grpc-service-response sink with source.id = 1 will send responses back for requests received to this source. Note that it is required to specify the transport property messageId since we need to correlate the request message with the response and also we should map stream attributes with correct protobuf message attributes even they define using the same name as protobuf message attributes.","title":"grpc-service (Source)"},{"location":"api/1.0.5/","text":"API Docs - v1.0.5 Tested Siddhi Core version: 5.1.5 It could also support other Siddhi Core minor versions.

A grpc server should be running at 194.23.98.100 listening to port 8080. @payload is provided in this stream, therefore we can use any name for the attributes in the stream definition, but we should correctly map those names with protobuf message attributes. If we are planning to send metadata within a stream we should use @payload to map attributes to identify the metadata attribute and the protobuf attributes separately.

Each received event is sent back through grpc-service-source. This is just a passthrough through Siddhi as we are selecting everything from FooStream and inserting into BarStream.

So a grpc server will be started on port 8888 and sever will keep listening to the 'send' method in the 'MyService' service. Since we provide mapping in the stream we can use any names for stream attributes, but we have to map those names with correct protobuf message attributes' names. If we want to send metadata, we should map the attributes.

Whenever we want to use streaming with grpc source, we have to define the RPC method as client streaming method (look at the sample proto file provided in the resource folder[here](https://github.com/siddhi-io/siddhi-io-grpc/tree/master/component/src/main/resources)), when we define a stream method siddhi will identify it as a stream RPC method and ready to accept stream of request from the client. grpc-call-response (Source) This grpc source receives responses received from gRPC server for requests sent from a grpc-call sink. The source will receive responses for sink with the same sink.id. For example if you have a gRPC sink with sink.id 15 then we need to set the sink.id as 15 in the source to receives responses. Sinks and sources have 1:1 mapping Syntax @source(type= grpc-call-response , sink.id= INT , @map(...)))

So a grpc server will be started on port 8888 and sever will keep listening to the 'send' method in the 'MyService' service. Since we provide mapping in the stream we can use any names for stream attributes, but we have to map those names with correct protobuf message attributes' names. If we want to send metadata, we should map the attributes.
